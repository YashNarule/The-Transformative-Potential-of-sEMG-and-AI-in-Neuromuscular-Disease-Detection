# The-Transformative-Potential-of-sEMG-and-AI-in-Neuromuscular-Disease-Detection

This work aims to identify suitable combination of filters for denoising the sEMG to make it suitable for classification of neuromuscular diseases. The identified combination of band pass filters and VMD based filters were used to reduce noise in sEMG.Since the invasive method ispredominantly used for being more accurate in terms of EMG signal acquisition for neuromuscular disease diagnosis.This research work emphasizes on sEMGacquisition by making it suitable for two class classifcation (ALS,non affected) of the neuromuscular diseases. To identify the accuracy of the classification using sEMG several Deep Learning models were used as a result of which CNN model with 1 D dilation and adam optimizer gave the accuracy of 98.4%. with the help of this study we can conclude that sEMG can also be used for effective diagnosis of nueromuscular disease.
